        <h1><span class="noun", style="color: blue">Elon Musk</span> is now worth more than ExxonMobil</h1>
        <p>New York (CNN Business) Tesla's Founder is rapidly approaching a net worth of $300 billion, as Tesla's market cap <span class="verb", style="color: green">soars</span> past $1 trillion. That's enough to <span class="verb3", style="color: green">surpass</span> one of his <span class="adj", style="color:purple">biggest</span> rivals: <span class="noun", style="color: blue">ExxonMobil.</span></p>
        <p>As of Monday's close, <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Musk</span>'s net worth was $289 billion, according to <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Bloomberg</span>, which <span class="verb4", style="color: green">surpasses</span> the $272 billion market value of <span class="noun", style="color: blue">ExxonMobil</span>.</p>
        <p>Speaking of rivals: <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Musk</span> is also worth more than fellow <span class="adj2", style="color:purple">famous</span> mega-billionaires <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Bill Gates</span> and <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Mark Zuckerberg combined.</span></p>
        <p>The Tesla CEO's jump in worth can be attributed to two things after shares of Tesla rose more than 12% Monday: Hertz (HTZ) announced a record order of 100,000 Teslas for its fleet, and influential Morgan Stanley auto analyst, <span class="noun", style="color: blue">Adam Jonas</span>, recently <span class="verb2", style="color: green">raised</span> his price target on Tesla to $1,200 a share. That hefty one-day gain put Tesla (TSLA) just over the $1 trillion mark.</p>
        <p><span class="noun", style="color: blue">Musk</span> is a leading advocate of switching drivers around the world from gas and diesel to electric vehicles, potentially endangering Exxon's long-term future. America's <span class="adj1", style="color:purple">largest</span> oil company has been sharply criticized for its climate strategy and two of its board seats went to a climate activist hedge fund.</p>
        <p>For Tesla, by contrast, Wall Street's excitement about the future of electric vehicles has <span class="verb2", style="color: green">pushed</span> the company's <span class="adj3", style="color:purple">enormous</span> market value to more than the 11 <span class="adj1", style="color:purple">largest</span> global automakers combined. Tesla is worth more than three times as much as <span class="noun", style="color: blue"> Toyota</span>, the second most valuable automaker, which has a market cap of about $280 billion, and boasts sales and profits that dwarf those of Tesla.</p>
        <p><span class="noun", style="color: blue">Musk</span> briefly eclipsed ExxonMobil's value once before, in early 2021. Exxon's stock is up nearly 60% this year as oil prices have climbed.</p>
